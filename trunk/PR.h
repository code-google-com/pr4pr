/**
 * \mainpage PR
 *
 * \author Bo Zhou
 * \date 2009
 *
 * \section Introduction
 * The "ParticleSolver"(PR) is a RenderMan procedural primitive framework DSO for particle-based
 * effect production. It extents the existing Maya particle function to do more. 
 *
 * \section Changelog
 * \date 2009/10/31
 * - Renamed "PolygonParticleSolver" to "SurfaceParticleSolver".
 * - "Diffusion" supports user defined random seed now.
